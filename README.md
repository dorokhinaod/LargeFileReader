# LargeFileReader

This program allows to count rows of the large text file and find substrings

The command to execute the program: 
    ``` mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.example.LargeFileReader"```

Finals:
    TEST_FILE_PATH - the path of text file; 
    SUBSTRING - substring that has to be counted

The task was solved by 2 ways (using Stream and BufferedReader), but there are no visible differences between the time of execution
